# Assignment 5: Java Lab

## Part 1: Shapes

### Introduction
This part of the assignment implements a simple Java program to calculate the area and perimeter of different shapes such as circles, rectangles, and triangles.

### Code Structure
- `shape` Interface: Defines methods for calculating area and perimeter.
- `Circle` Class: Implements the `shape` interface to calculate area and perimeter of a circle.
- `Rectangle` Class: Implements the `shape` interface to calculate area and perimeter of a rectangle.
- `Triangle` Class: Implements the `shape` interface to calculate area and perimeter of a triangle.
- `Main` Class: Provides a menu-driven interface for the user to input the shape and calculates its area and perimeter accordingly.

### Usage
1. Compile and run the `Main.java` file.
2. Enter the desired shape (circle, rectangle, or triangle) when prompted.
3. Follow the instructions to input the required dimensions.
4. The program will display the calculated area and perimeter of the chosen shape.

## Part 2: Employee Salary Calculation

### Introduction
This part of the assignment implements a Java program to calculate the salary of normal and special employees based on their basic wages, allowances, and deductions.

### Code Structure
- `Employee` Abstract Class: Defines common attributes and methods for an employee.
- `NormalEmployee` Class: Extends `Employee` class to calculate the salary of a normal employee.
